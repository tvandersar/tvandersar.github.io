# Open positions

**We will have a PhD position available from Jan. 2023 related to our [ENW-XL grant](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2022/tnw/nwo-enw-xl-grant-for-research-into-razor-thin-magnets).**

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:t.vandersar@tudelft.nl). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for separate certificates. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

We welcome postdocs with fellowships. I'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme-veni-science-domain) or the Marie Curie fellowship, [here is a previous call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)). In many countries, there are fellowships available for outgoing postdocs.**


### Master/bachelor projects for TU Delft students
For information on possible MSc or BSc thesis projects, please contact Toeno at t.vandersar@tudelft.nl.

Note that Masters and Bachelors projects are only available to students already enrolled in a Bachelors or Masters program at a university in the Netherlands. For information about enrolling for the Bachelors or Masters program at TU Delft, please consult the TU-Delft homepage.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
Sometimes, we can host master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
