# Research
The properties of materials play a major role in our society. Magnetic materials are used in generators and hard disks. Superconductors are essential for MRI scanners. The electrical properties of semiconductors is at the heart of integrated circuit technologies.
 
In recent years, new classes of materials with counterintuitive magnetic and electrical properties have been discovered. Examples include graphene in which electrons behave like light, van-der-Waals magnets that enable two-dimensional spin transport, and insulating oxides that when stacked yield a 2D electron gas. Understanding how spins and charges move in these ‘quantum materials’ is interesting in its own right, but may also enable new functionalities and minimized dissipation in future devices. 

The goal our group is to study the nanoscale charge- and spin-transport properties of materials that are both fundamentally intriguing and potentially useful for devices. We are particularly interested in how interacting charges and spins move through systems of solid-state materials. The vision is to realize a set of nanoscale imaging and electronic-transport tools that enable new ways to address this topic. Along these lines, we have developed an exciting new technique for imaging the collective spin excitations known as spin waves in magnetic materials (more below).
  
A central role in our lab is played by nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, which we use as magnetic-field sensors. This involves photoluminescence microscopy with single-photon sensitivity, single-spin microwave control, electronic transport, and scanning-probe microscopy. With these techniques we pursue the vision described above, focusing on two main research directions:

1)	Spin-wave transport in thin-film magnets (largest effort)
2)	Imaging electrical currents in quantum materials (just taking off in the context of our NWO VIDI project)

**Spin waves**
Spin waves are the elementary excitations of magnetic materials. A growing research field is focusing on creating spin-wave technology, such as spin-wave transistors. Theory is addressing fundamental questions about nanoscale spin-wave transport, the interaction of spin waves with other excitations such as phonons, adding excitement by predicting exotic phenomena such as spin superfluidity and the spin-wave quantum-Hall effect. Being able to probe and control spin-wave transport with high resolution at buried magnetic interfaces is key to realizing these exciting prospects.

To this end, we have developed a new technique for imaging spin waves [Bertelli2020] using nitrogen-vacancy sensor spins in diamond (Fig. 2A-B). Because the imaging is magnetic, in contrast with other imaging techniques, we can ‘look through’ optically opaque materials [Bertelli2020]. We are leveraging this capability to study the interaction between spin waves and metals. We recently demonstrated the dramatic impact of metals on the damping of spin waves [Bertelli2021]. This is important as the majority of applications and devices use metal electrodes to generate and control spin waves. We study spin waves on the nanoscale using NV-diamond tips that we fabricate in our Kavli nanolab. This scanning-probe system enables few-nanometer proximity of the NV sensors to the material and, as a result, the detection of minute spin-wave stray fields with high spatial resolution. We have shown that the excitation of coherent spin waves injects a high density of magnons into the spin-wave band [Simon2021]. Such out-of-equilibrium magnon densities can be used to control spin currents and enable studying interactions within the magnon gas. We also study spin waves in engineered low-damping magnetic insulators with small anisotropy [Carmiggelt2021] that facilitate the realization of spin-wave optics.
